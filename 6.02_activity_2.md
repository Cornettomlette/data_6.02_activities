# 6.02 Activity 2

In this activity you can continue using the previous Tableau workbook.
If you are using a new workbook, use the file `sample_superstore.xls`. Create a join between `orders` and `returns`, and add a filter for orders made in 2017. Now follow the steps below:

- Create a parameter called `parameter_quantity`. It should be of type integer and should take a range of values, with minimum value of 1, maximum value of 100, and a step size of 1.
- Create a calculated field `calculated_quantity` as

  ```sql
  IF [Quantity] = [Parameter_quantity] THEN "Yes"
  ELSE "No"
  END
  ```

- Create a plot between `Customer Name` and `Discount` (with average as aggregation).
- Add the parameter to the sheet.
- Vary the parameter and observe how the plot changes.
  Note: This can used to analyze how the discounts are provided to different customers based on the quantity ordered.
